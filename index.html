<p>Hi my name is Weston I'm from Tennessee! I am a buisness major here at BYUI. I like hiking, swimming, skateboarding, and climbing! I'm hoping to learn how to better my coding skills and see where I can go with it. I served a mission trip in Independence Missouri almost a year ago. Often times I enjoy reading self-help books, listening to music, and hanging out with freinds.</p>
